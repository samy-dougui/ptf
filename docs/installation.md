# Installation

## Specific version
WIP


## From source

To install PTF from source, follow this procedure:
1. Clone the git repository locally: `git clone git@github.com:samy-dougui/ptf.git`
2. Build the CLI: `go build`
3. You can now use PTF: `./ptf -v`

To be able to use it from anywhere on your machine, you can add it to your `PATH`.
