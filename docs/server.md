# PTF Server

> This section is a work in progress

## How to start ptf server?

To start a ptf server, run the command `ptf server`. This will spin up an HTTP server that will listen, by default, to
the port 8080.

You can change the port it will listen to by running `ptf server --port YOUR-PORT`.
